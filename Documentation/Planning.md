1. Read competition info, existing info and relevant content to feel confortable with the problem. Create hyphotesis based in that info;
2. Initial data exploration, again to feel confortable with the problem and the data;
3. Build the first implementation (simple);
4. Loop throught [Analyze -> Approach(model) -> Implement -> Measure].

## 1. Literature review (relevant kernels and content related to the competition).
