## Model backlog (list of developed model and it's score)
- **Train** and **validation** are the splits using the train data from the competition.
- The competition metric is **Jigsaw Bias AUC**.
- **Runtime** is the time in seconds that the kernel took to finish.
- **Pb Leaderboard** is the Public Leaderboard score.
- **Pv Leaderboard** is the Private Leaderboard score.
